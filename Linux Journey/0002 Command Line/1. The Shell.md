# 1. The Shell

### What is the Linux Shell

Welcome to your **Linux journey**! The first step is understanding the **Linux shell**. The shell is a powerful program that accepts your typed commands and passes them to the operating system to execute. If you've used a graphical user interface (GUI), you might have encountered applications like "Terminal" or "Console." These are simply programs that open a shell session for you. Throughout this course, we will explore the capabilities of the shell and the many **Linux commands** available.

### Understanding Bash

For this course, we will focus on the Bash (Bourne Again Shell) program. Bash is the default shell for most Linux distributions, making it an essential tool to learn. While other shells like `ksh`, `zsh`, and `tsch` exist, mastering Bash provides a solid foundation for working with any Linux system.

### The Shell Prompt

When you open a terminal, you'll be greeted by the shell prompt. Its appearance can vary between distributions, but it typically follows this format: `username@hostname:current_directory$`.

```plaintext
pete@icebox:/home/pete $
```

The `$` symbol at the end indicates that the shell is ready to accept commands from a regular user. You do not type this symbol when entering commands; it is purely informational.

### Your First Linux Command

Let's start with one of the most **basic Linux commands for beginners**: `echo`. This command is straightforward—it simply displays, or "echoes," the text you provide as arguments back to the terminal.

```bash
echo Hello World
```
