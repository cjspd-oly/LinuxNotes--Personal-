# 1. Linux History

Welcome to your **Linux Journey**! If you're ready to dive into the powerful world of Linux, you've come to the right place. My name is Penguin Pete, and I'll be your guide. To get started, let's explore a brief **history of Linux**.

### The Predecessors of Linux

To understand how Linux was created, we must go back to 1969 when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in the C programming language, which made it portable and led to its widespread adoption.

Over a decade later, Richard Stallman initiated the GNU (a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not UNIX") project. The goal was to create a completely free and open-source UNIX-like operating system. While the GNU project produced many essential components, including the GNU General Public License (GPL), its own kernel, named Hurd, was not completed in time.

### The Role of the Kernel

The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It acts as a bridge, allowing the hardware to communicate with the software. The kernel manages system resources, such as the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. Essentially, the kernel controls everything that happens on your system. While other UNIX-like systems such as BSD and MINIX were being developed, they all lacked a freely available and unified kernel.

### The Birth of the Linux Kernel

This brings us to 1991, when a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds began developing a new kernel as a personal project. This kernel, which we now know as the Linux kernel, filled the missing piece of the GNU operating system. The combination of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel created the complete, open-source operating system that is widely used today. This milestone was a pivotal moment in the **history of Linux**.

# Summary
## The Predecessors of Linux
### GNU Project
- A recursive acronym for **“GNU’s Not Unix”**
- Designed to be **Unix-like**, but different from Unix by being **free software** and containing **no Unix code**
- Initiated by **Richard Stallman**
- Produced essential components such as:
    - GNU General Public License (GPL)
    - Compilers, libraries, shells, and core utilities
- Its own kernel, **Hurd**, was **not completed in time**
### GNU Tools
- Free, open-source system utilities from the GNU Project
- Provide core commands, libraries, compilers, and shells
- Examples: `ls`, `gcc`, `glibc`, `bash`
## Kernel
- Core component of an operating system
- Acts as an interface between **hardware and software**
- Manages:
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Peripheral devices
## The Birth of the Linux Kernel
- Created by **Linus Torvalds**
## The Birth of Linux
- **GNU tools + Linux kernel** formed a complete, open-source operating system
- Linux succeeded because GNU already had everything **except a working kernel**
- Hurd’s delay made Linux the missing piece
